Dear visitor,

Welcome to the repository with supplementary material on

"Optimized convergence of stochastic gradient descent by weighted averaging" (2022),
by Melinda Hagedorn and Florian Jarre,

whose preprint is available on

https://optimization-online.org/2022/09/optimized-convergence-of-stochastic-gradient-descent-by-weighted-averaging/


The files "tableX.m" for X = 01,02,..,13 contain short Matlab files with which the thirteen tables and figure 1 were generated. Please note that function tpk4par.m is needed for tables 1,...,6. 

Furthermore, for some tables the following external code is necessary:

min_f.m and min_fc.m which can be found on <br>
http://www.opt.uni-duesseldorf.de/en/forschung-fs.html

t10k-images-idx3-ubyte, t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte, train-images-idx3-ubyte an train-labels-idx1-ubyte available on <br>
